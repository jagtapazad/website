<p>I am a person with believes, believes which are based upon life lessons.
   And here at this stage of my life I believe that
   <u><strong><i>"Life is Solely a Game of Probability and Everyone has their Shares of Bais".</i></strong></u>
   It's nature of Life to be unpredictable; You and I are just an data entry for the probability distribution,
   but it's always your choice to be a rare data entry or just a common one.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a boy I was always very humble, never wanted anything what I have today.
  Still here we are me studying at top engineering institute
  in India, learning new things,
  having awesome friends and family and most of all living a good life.
  <br>
  The one thing which always stick with me is that
  <h3>I always strive to improve myself and achieve more!</h3>
